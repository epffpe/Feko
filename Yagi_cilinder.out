 Storage using single precision

 Memory requirement for MoM matrix:      8976 rows *    38228 columns =   343134528 complex numbers
 For the MoM matrix, a memory of     80543972 complex numbers is used (i.e.  614.502 MByte)
 Storing the matrix and solving the linear set of equations in main memory (case 2)

     A total memory of  625.100 MByte has been allocated dynamically
     (peak memory usage so far  625.100 MByte)


     No efficient calculation of the matrix elements for triangles

 NOTE     3725: Usage of symmetry only possible in part since not enough main memory
