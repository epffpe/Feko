 (that many parallel processes may be run with your sequential FEKO licence)
 NOTE    35127: You are running a sequential version of FEKO, but it was detected that your CPU has more than one core. For best performance, it would be recommended to run the parallel FEKO kernel (your licence allows this)


                    YZ-plane is a magnetic conducting wall

          Mirroring in yz-plane: 
                               108 metallic triangles
                                68 triangles in the dielectric

          Scaling of the geometry with factor SKAL =  1.00000E-03

          Surface of all triangles in m*m:     0.00092

          Length of the segments in m:         0.0015

 The segment no. 1 with radius   0.005 m
 at the connection point no. 1 is thick as compared to the
 edge length   0.00175539122 m of the connected triangle no. 20
 ERROR    2701: A wire segment at a connection point is too thick as compared to the triangle size
